# BankTellerApp
A console application with various kinds of bank accounts implementing deposit and withdrawal functionality. 

The application begins by implementing this functionality using implementation inheritance from an abstract BankAccount parent class, and using mutable fields to keep track of the amount in each account. It is then refactored to use composable decorators implementating an abstract account interface with immutable fields.
